Application Description
This application serves as a dynamic platform tailored for data enthusiasts, enabling users to swiftly manipulate and visualize datasets. Through an intuitive user interface, users can import, edit, and export data while also leveraging advanced analytics tools for a comprehensive data overview.

Regex Implementation Description
Our application boasts a sophisticated Regex (Regular Expression) implementation that aids in the parsing, searching, and manipulation of text within the datasets. Users can apply Regex patterns to filter, find, or replace specific strings, making data cleansing and transformation more streamlined. This feature is especially beneficial for large datasets where manual data inspection can be tedious. To cater to both novices and experts, we've incorporated a user-friendly Regex helper, providing examples and quick tests for pattern validation.

Got it. Given that it's an Android project, the instructions for opening and running the project tests locally would typically involve Android Studio and the Gradle build system. Here's a revised section for opening and running the tests:

How to Open and Run Project Tests Locally
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
Open the Project:

Launch Android Studio.
Click on "Open an existing Android Studio project" or "File" > "Open".
Navigate to the cloned repository and select the project's root directory.
Sync Gradle:
Once the project is loaded, Android Studio might prompt you to sync the project with Gradle files. Make sure you do this. It will ensure that all dependencies are correctly set up.

Run the Tests:

In the Project pane on the left side of the Android Studio window, navigate to your project's module app.
Right-click on the app module or the module that contains your tests.
Choose Run 'Tests in [module-name]' from the context menu.
Viewing Test Results:

Once tests are completed, you can view results in the Run window at the bottom of the Android Studio interface.
Note: Ensure you have Android Studio installed with the necessary SDKs. If you encounter issues, check the project's build.gradle file for specific dependencies or SDK version requirements.
